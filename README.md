Wanted a example of Key Listener use but this lead me to the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/keybinding.html">Key Binding </a> and <a hrefd="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/AbstractButton.html"> Abstract Button</a> APIs which I found allowed me to programmatically "click" the on-screen buttons using the keyboard without having to duplicate code.
